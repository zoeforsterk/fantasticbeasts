<h2> BOWTRUCKLE </h2>
   
<p>The Bowtruckle is a hand-sized, insect-eating, tree dwelling magical beast with long sharp fingers, brown eyes, and a general appearance of a flat-faced stick figure made of bark and twigs, which served well as camouflage in its natural habitat. They are immensely difficult to spot.</p>
<p>The Bowtruckle can be found in western England, southern Germany, and certain Scandinavian forests. A Bowtruckle serves as a tree guardian for its home tree, which was usually a tree whose wood was of wand quality (such as a Wiggentree). The twig-like fingers were well adapted for digging out wood lice in trees and can also be used as a weapon against a foe when aimed at the eyes.</p>
<p>It is generally a peaceful creature, but it may attempt to gouge out an attacker's eyes if anything threatened its tree or itself, and is adept at dodging most types of charms. </p>
